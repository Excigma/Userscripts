# Userscripts

This repo contains a collection of scripts that I've made for various websites. They are all written in JavaScript and are meant to be used with the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) browser extension. The scripts are meant to automate, simplify, or otherwise improve the user experience of the websites they are made for.

Some scripts no longer work because the website they were made for has changed.
