# UoA SSO Timetable to iCalendar

This script fetches data from the timetable on SSO (Student Services Online) and converts it into `.ics` format. This script was written as UoA decommissioned UoACal with zero notice and has yet to communicate when a replacement service would be available.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Standard cybersecurity warning:**
> Do not blindly run code from untrusted sources. Please audit the code before running it.

## Usage

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### ⚠️ **Create a new calendar in your calendar application separate from your main calendar.**
> 
> **This script works differently to UoACal**, the `.ics` file that this script will import events into your calendar.
>
> Import the `.ics` file into the separate calendar, in case you need to delete all the events created by this script, **otherwise, you will need to manually delete the (30, for me) events in the calendar.**
> You may want to delete all the events generated by this script for a few reasons:
> - The script is not working properly and generates classes with incorrect dates or times.
> - You have changed your enrollments and wish to update your timetable again. You need to delete the previous events and import them again.
>   - **⚠️ Previous events may not get deleted (causing a double-up).**
>   - **⚠️ Changed class times may not get deleted.**
> 
> Use at your own risk. Verify the calendar is correct before confirming the import into your calendar application.

0. Please read the `Important` block above
1. Go to the ["My Class Timetable" page on SSO](https://www.student.auckland.ac.nz/psc/ps/EMPLOYEE/SA/c/UOA_MENU_FL.UOA_VW_CAL_FL.GBL)
2. Open the JavaScript Console:
   - On Google Chrome/Microsoft Edge/Mozilla Firefox: `ctrl` + `shift` + `I`, then click on the `[Console]` tab at the top
   - On Safari on macOS (unverified; I do not have macOS):
     - You will need to enable the "Develop" menu in the menu bar:
       - `⌘` + `,` to open Safari Preferences, or use the "Safari" Menu
       - Navigate to the "Advanced" tab, find "Show Develop menu in menu bar" and enable this setting
     - `Option` + `⌘` + `C` to open the JavaScript Console, or use the "Show JavaScript Console" in the "Develop" menu
3. Copy the code from  [uoa-timetable-to-ical.user.js](https://github.com/Excigma/Userscripts/blob/trunk/student.auckland.ac.nz/uoa-timetable-to-ical.user.js)
4. Paste the code into the console. You may need to allow pasting before your browser allows you to paste code into the console
5. Press Enter to run the code. You should see the script switching to the "List View" tab, opening "Meeting Information" for each meeting, and finally downloading a file: `uoa-sso-calendar.ics`. The `.ics` file's contents will be logged to the console as well
6. Note: Importing events from `.ics` files might be a **difficult to reverse action** depending on your calendar application. Read the `Important` block above before importing the `.ics` file.

> [!NOTE]
> This will NOT work if your timezone is not `Pacific/Auckland` (e.g., you are overseas). Change your device timezone to `Pacific/Auckland`
